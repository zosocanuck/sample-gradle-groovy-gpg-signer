## Sample Gradle Groovy project to sign archives using GPG

This sample Gradle project demonstrates how to create and sign an archive (zip) using the [Gradle signing plugin](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/signing_plugin.html)

For Venafi users you will need to configure the build environment to use the Venafi CSP client with GPG. See [docs](https://docs.venafi.com/Docs/current/TopNav/Content/CodeSigning/t-codesigning-working-with-gpg.php?tocpath=CodeSign%20Protect%7CSetting%20up%20the%20CodeSign%20Protect%20clients%7CSetting%20up%20GPG%20clients%7C_____0)
